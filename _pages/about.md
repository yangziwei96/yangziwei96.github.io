My name is Ziwei Yang (楊 子威), currently I am a Ph.D. student with Prof. [Tatsuya Akutsu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IwippccAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Takeyuki Tamura](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OfCjNzEAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Lab of Mathematical Bioinformatics of Kyoto University.
I received my master's degree from the Computational Systems Biology Lab of Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), under the supervision of Prof. [Shigehiko Kanaya](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4Onx7zgAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie in machine learning and data analysis methods and their application to biomedical areas, such as deep learning algorithms for healthcare and bio-networks analysis.
